## Summary Of Work Completed So Far

The work we have finished so far can be summaried into three different
categories. They include a finalization of the preliminary outline of the 
parallel API we want to provide the users of our package, a sequential 
implementation of a simple GridWorld example that have created using our own
environment package, as well as a clarification of what our project deliverables
will likely be at the end of the project timeline.
